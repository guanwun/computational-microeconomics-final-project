This is the final project of Advanced Topics in Computer Science: Computational Microeconomics (COMPSCI 590.04) at Duke University. We apply the two voting mechanisms, namely Quadratic Voting (QV) and Proportional Approval Voting (PAV), to a common real world setting of deciding on cities to visit during a group vacation. While QV does better in terms of efficiency and PAV aims for fairness, we analyze their overall performances under different criteria.

Based on our survey, we establish three conclusions. First, in comparison of total efficiency, PAV results in lower utilities than QV, and the efficiency in PAV decreases more as more cities are selected. Secondly, regarding individual efficiency, voters generally give up more utilities under PAV than QV, and the efficiency loss as well as the marginal efficiency loss are greater under PAV. Even though PAV is less efficient in individual sense, QV is not better by much because voters give up their top priorities in order to travel as a group. Thirdly, we look at the number of approved cities a voter gets as the criterion of fairness. While QV achieves higher maximum total utility, PAV is a better measurement of fairness. We summarize that QV allows voters to express their true intensity of preferences and is more efficient than PAV; on the other hand, PAV is a straightforward voting mechanism which maximizes fairness among voters.
