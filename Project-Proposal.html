<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Applications of
voting are commonly seen in day to day life. From deciding among
dinner choices to electing a leader for the country, we want to
select an outcome that maximizes common interests of all concerned
parties. Voting rules are designed to help us make such decisions
based on preferences of agents. However, none of them are perfect in
all dimensions.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">In this project, we
hope to tackle a seemingly simple problem of planning a vacation with
friends. Though this seems like a very basic problem, rich analysis
under different scenarios will allow us to potentially extend this
model to a wide range of problems.

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Suppose
a group of friends are deciding on places to visit in Europe during
their vacation. Each individual is given a fixed number of choices
and a limited time and money budget. We make the following
assumptions about the base model setup (we wish to relax some of
these for further analysis): 
</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Every person
	has a strict preference over all the given choices</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Every person
	prefers these choices to any other choices for vacation spots</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Every person
	has not visited any of these places before</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Weight
	difference between choices is the same across each person’s type 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Temporary
	situations and world news like epidemics and bombings do not affect
	preferences</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<ol start="2">

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Empirical
	Study</b></p>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">To
choose the best plan for the vacation, we plan on using at least
three voting rules. We want to incorporate the Clarke’s mechanism,
and device two others that are related to majority and pairwise
elections but also concentrating on fairness. Each of these rules
will have their own advantages and disadvantages and we hope to
compare them by examining the data collected from sample surveys. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
will gather sample data through surveys sent to students in the
class. The first round of survey aims to collect information about
each student’s preference over the entire set, while the second
round we plan to assign a budget to each student and have them spend
it on their preferred destinations. In each round each student votes
once completely unaware of the mechanism and a second time knowing
about the mechanism. (An additional variation we want to add, time
permitting, is to pick our destinations without ignoring travel time
and distance between cities.)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">We
plan on developing linear programs for each of the three voting rules
we use, as a means of evaluating the information we gather from the
surveys. We would also like to look into how the problem scales, and
whether it is solvable in polynomial time or if it is NP-Hard. 
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><b>Goal </b>
	</p>
</ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%">Based
on empirical evidence, we would like to understand and analyze the
different types of outcomes we get with each of these voting rules.
We want to maximize “happiness” while being fair. As an extended
research, see if our observations from here would have any
implications for other voting problems. As a minimum, we will at
least have an idea and working model to decide on the best vacation
plan with our friends.
